STUFF WE NEED
•	HTML, CSS (Bootstrap or other third party library) and Jinja2
•	Python using the Flask micro-framework
•	Interaction with a SQL database (SQLite is preferred though MySQL or Postgresql are accepted)
•	Has a responsive design. Responsive design means that it displays reasonably on devices of different dimensions such as mobile phone and laptop computer. This can be achieved using a 3rd party library such as Bootstrap.
•	Allows your Dash app to be launched as a route in the web app.
•	Provides signup/login/logout and restriction of some content to logged in users.
•	Captures and stores data entered by users of the app.
•	Uses and/or displays data stored in a SQLite database.
•	TWO additional features: user profiles and forums
