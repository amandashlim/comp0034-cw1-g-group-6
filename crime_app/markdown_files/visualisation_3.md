# Visualisation 3: The Line Chart

The target audience for our map visualisation is anyone who is either moving to or living in London, who is interested in learning about and comparing the crime rates for each form of crime in the different london boroughs.

The questions that this visualisation is intended to address are the following:

    1. How has drug crime evolved in London over the two recorded years?
    2. How does sexual offences fluctuate over the four seasons?

### 1. Explaining the design

We created a line chart in order to answer the two questions stated previously. 
The line chart allows users to see the fluctuation of the number of crime over the months, which could allow them to observe a pattern seasonally.

Once again, we included the option to select filters on the left-hand side of the dashboard, where users are able to specify which type of crime they would like information on.
This aspect provides our webapp users with the option to personalise their searches with what they are interested in.
