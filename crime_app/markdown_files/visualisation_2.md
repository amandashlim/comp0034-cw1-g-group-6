# Visualisation 2: The Histogram

The target audience for our map visualisation is anyone who is either moving to or living in London, who is interested in learning about and comparing the crime rates for each form of crime in the different london boroughs.

The question that this visualisation is intended to address is the following:

    1. Which type of crime is the highest and lowest in London?

### 1. Explaining the design

To answer the question stated above, we decided that a histogram would be the most effective visual.
It allows users to see the counts for each type of crime and compare them with each other, to know which crimes are the highest and lowest in London.

We decided to add a slider allowing users to select a specific time range, within the data we have. 
Therefore, users are able to select a specific timeframe, such as a season, to see whether the crime counts of the different types of crime fluctuate during different periods. 

On the left-hand side of the dashboard, we included filters where users can choose one or multiple boroughs they would like to have shown in the histogram.
This allows them to either look at the crime counts for a specific borough they are interested in or look at the crime counts for a larger area.

### 2. Evaluating the design
