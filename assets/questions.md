Using the dataset we have been provided with, we will ask ourselves the following questions so that we can explore the data:

    1. How has drug crime evolved in London over the two recorded years?
    2. Which type of crime is the highest and lowest in London?
    3. How does sexual offences fluctuate over the four seasons?
    4. Which borough has the highest crime rates in London?

The types of graphs for each question:

1 - histogram with the counts of reported crimes for each month over the 2 years
2 - 
3 - 
4 - chloropleth map to show which area has most/ less crime
