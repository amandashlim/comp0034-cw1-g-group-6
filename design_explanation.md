# Visualisations Design Explanations

For our Dash App, we came up with three different visualisations to answer questions which may be asked by our target audience.
In coursework 1 of COMP0035, we asked ourselves four questions in relation to the Metropolitan Police dataset which were the following:

    1. How has drug crime evolved in London over the two recorded years?
    2. Which type of crime is the highest and lowest in London?
    3. How does sexual offences fluctuate over the four seasons?
    4. Which borough has the highest crime rates in London?

To answer these questions, we decided to create three visualisations which include:

    1. A chloropleth map
    2. A histogram
    3. A line chart

Each of these visualisations are able to answer each of the four questions the target audience may ask. However, some of the visualisations more adapted to answer specific questions thanks to their format.


Before explaining the design of our visualisations, let's remind ourselves of our target audience.

### 1. Target Audience

![Persona](crime_app/assets/persona.png)

Our target audience for the webapp, would be university students who are new to London and looking for accommodation.
Since our target audience is assumed to not know London, the webapp would be useful as it would allow them to be informed on the crime rates associated with each London borough.
Moreover, based on personal preferences, they would be able to tailor their searches to the crimes they are more concerned about.
