# Visualisations Design Explanations

For our Dash App, we came up with three different visualisations to answer questions which may be asked by our target audience.
In coursework 1 of COMP0035, we asked ourselves four questions in relation to the Metropolitan Police dataset which were the following:

    1. How has drug crime evolved in London over the two recorded years?
    2. Which type of crime is the highest and lowest in London?
    3. How does sexual offences fluctuate over the four seasons?
    4. Which borough has the highest crime rates in London?

To answer these questions, we decided to create three visualisations which include:

    1. A chloropleth map
    2. A histogram
    3. A line chart

Each of these visualisations are able to answer each of the four questions the target audience may ask. However, some of the visualisations more adapted to answer specific questions thanks to their format.


Before explaining the design of our visualisations, let's remind ourselves of our target audience.
