# Visualisation 3: The Line Chart

The target audience for our map visualisation is anyone who is either moving to or living in London, who is interested in learning about and comparing the crime rates for each form of crime in the different london boroughs.

The questions that this visualisation is intended to address are the following:

    1. How has drug crime evolved in London over the two recorded years?
    2. How does sexual offences fluctuate over the four seasons?

### *1. Explaining the design*

We created a line chart in order to answer the two questions stated previously. 
The line chart allows users to see the fluctuation of the number of crime over the months, which could allow them to observe a pattern seasonally.

Once again, we included the option to select filters on the left-hand side of the dashboard, where users are able to specify which type of crime they would like information on.
This aspect provides our webapp users with the option to personalise their searches with what they are interested in.


### *2. Evaluating the design*

To create the line chart, we used multiple datasets; the main dataset used was the Metropolitan police dataset (crime_data.csv).
We also used multiple other datasets so that users could look at the line chart through different data on the population as we can see in the filters on the left-hand side of the dashboard.
The other datasets used were for raw data (population.csv), population - 2020 GLA estimate (pop2020_df_r.json), population - 2011 Census (pop2011_df_r.json), workday population (workday_df_r.json) and total daytime population (daytime_df_r.json and daytime_population.csv). 

We used all the data from each dataset listed above to answer the questions.





    => what data from the dataset is needed to answer the question (idk if we should add this above before 1. or here)
    => How well does the visualisation you created meet with the design choices you made?
    => What are the strengths and weaknesses of the design with respect to the target audience and the question you were intending to answer?
    => If relevant, suggest any ways in which your visualisation design could be improved.
