# Visualisation 1: The Map

The target audience for our map visualisation is anyone who is either moving to or living in London and hence, is looking for somewhere to live. The target audience wants to learn and compare the crime rates in the different london boroughs. Furthermore, they are looking for insights into the occurrences of different forms of crime.

The map visualisation is intended to address are the following questions:

    1. How has drug crime evolved in London over the two recorded years?
    2. Which borough has the highest crime rates in London?

### 1. Explaining the design

We chose to create a map as it is an effective visualisation for our webapp users to compare the London boroughs' crime rates. This is because a map is intuitive and fit for interactivity. 
Simply reading the data in numeric form would make it difficult for users to grasp a true visual understanding of the crime rates in different boroughs as users would not understand the context of each measurement of crime as part of a whole picture in london.
A map allows users to compare the crime rates using a colour spectrum system, where the colour purple signifies a low crime rate and the colour yellow signifies a high crime rate.

We also decided to provide our users with a slider, allowing them to see how the crime rates have evolved over the recorded months.
Therefore, if they are looking at a specific borough they are interested in, they can see the colour change and find out if the crime rate in that area has increased or decreased over the months.

Finally, on the left-hand side of the dashboard, we can see that there is a section enabling users to select filters in relation to the types of crime.
These filters allow our webapp users to tailor their map to their preferences.

### 2. Evaluating our visualisation

need to add:

    => what data for the dataset is needed to answer the question (idk if we should add this above before 1. or here)
    => visual aspects of the design (should we put here or in 1.?)
    => How well does the visualisation you created meet with the design choices you made?
    => What are the strengths and weaknesses of the design with respect to the target audience and the question you were intending to answer?
    => If relevant, suggest any ways in which your visualisation design could be improved.
